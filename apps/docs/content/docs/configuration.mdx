# Configuration

muxa is designed to work with zero configuration, but understanding how it detects and works with your project structure can help you get the most out of it.

## Zero Config Philosophy

muxa requires no configuration files. It automatically:

- Detects your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)
- Finds workspace packages in monorepos
- Handles different monorepo structures
- Wraps commands appropriately

## Package Manager Detection

muxa automatically detects your package manager using these methods:

### 1. Lock Files

Checks for lock files in order:
- `bun.lockb` → Bun
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm
- `yarn.lock` → Yarn
- `package-lock.json` → npm

### 2. packageManager Field

Reads the `packageManager` field in package.json:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "pnpm@8.0.0"
}
```

### 3. Workspace Configuration

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` → pnpm
- `workspaces` in package.json → npm/yarn/bun

## Monorepo Support

muxa understands common monorepo structures:

### npm/Yarn/Bun Workspaces

```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*",
    "apps/*",
    "tools/*"
  ]
}
```

### pnpm Workspaces

```yaml
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
packages:
  - 'packages/*'
  - 'apps/*'
  - '!**/test/**'
```

### Directory Structures

muxa recognizes these common patterns:
- `packages/*` - Shared packages
- `apps/*` - Applications
- `services/*` - Microservices
- `tools/*` - Build tools
- `libs/*` - Libraries

## Workspace Resolution

When you reference a workspace, muxa tries to find it by:

1. **Package name** (from package.json)
   ```bash
   muxa -s @myapp/core build
   ```

2. **Relative path**
   ```bash
   muxa -s packages/core build
   ```

3. **Directory name** (if unique)
   ```bash
   muxa -s core build
   ```

<Callout type="info">
Run `muxa workspaces` to see how muxa detects your packages.
</Callout>

## Script Execution

### Package Manager Scripts

muxa runs scripts using your detected package manager:

- npm: `npm run <script>`
- yarn: `yarn run <script>`
- pnpm: `pnpm run <script>`
- bun: `bun run <script>`

### Working Directory

For workspace commands, muxa:
1. Changes to the package directory
2. Runs the command
3. Preserves the package's environment

## Environment Variables

### Automatic Variables

muxa sets these automatically:
- `FORCE_COLOR=1` - Preserve colored output
- Inherits all parent process variables

### Custom Variables

Set variables per command:
```bash
muxa -c 'NODE_ENV=production npm run build' build
```

## Platform Differences

### macOS/Linux

- Full feature support
- Native terminal capabilities
- Smooth scrolling and selection

### Windows

- Best with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Git Bash also works
- Some terminal features may be limited

### CI Environments

muxa works in CI but consider:
- No interactive features needed
- May want to use `concurrently` for simpler output
- Exit codes are properly propagated

## Best Practices

### 1. Monorepo Structure

Organize packages clearly:
```
my-app/
├── package.json
├── apps/
│   ├── web/
│   └── mobile/
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/
│   └── core/
└── services/
    ├── api/
    └── auth/
```

### 2. Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent names:
```bash
# Good
muxa -s apps/web dev frontend \
     -s services/api dev backend

# Less clear
muxa -s web dev w \
     -s api dev a
```

### 3. Script Organization

Keep related scripts together:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "dev:host": "vite --host",
    "dev:debug": "DEBUG=* vite"
  }
}
```

### 4. Process Dependencies

Start dependent services first:
```bash
# Start database, then API, then frontend
muxa -c 'docker-compose up -d postgres' db \
     -s backend dev api \
     -s frontend dev web
```

## Troubleshooting

### Package Not Found

If muxa can't find a package:

1. Check workspace configuration
2. Verify package.json exists
3. Use full path or package name
4. Run `muxa workspaces` to debug

### Script Not Found

If a script doesn't exist:

1. Verify script name in package.json
2. Check you're using the right package
3. Ensure dependencies are installed

### Detection Issues

If package manager detection fails:

1. Ensure lock file exists
2. Check packageManager field
3. Run from project root

## Future Configuration

While muxa currently requires no configuration, future versions may support:

- `.muxarc` file for saved command sets
- Project-specific defaults
- Team-shared configurations
- CI-specific optimizations

These would remain optional, maintaining the zero-config philosophy.
