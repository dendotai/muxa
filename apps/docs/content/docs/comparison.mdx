## vs concurrently

[concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) is the most popular tool for running multiple commands.

### Advantages of muxa

- **Preserves interactivity** - Vite shortcuts, Expo QR codes work
- **Better output** - Clean terminal UI with mprocs
- **Monorepo native** - Built-in workspace support
- **Simpler syntax** - Cleaner command structure

### When to use concurrently

- Simple CI pipelines
- Basic parallel execution
- Existing scripts using it
- No interactive features needed

### Migration Example

```bash
# concurrently
concurrently -n "api,web" \
  "cd packages/api && npm run dev" \
  "cd packages/web && npm run dev"

# muxa
muxa -s api dev api -s web dev web
```

## vs mprocs (direct usage)

[mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs) is what powers muxa's terminal UI.

### Advantages of muxa

- **No config files** - Pure CLI interface
- **Simpler syntax** - More intuitive commands
- **Workspace aware** - Understands monorepos
- **Auto shell wrapping** - Handles complex commands

### When to use mprocs directly

- Need advanced mprocs features
- Want config file control
- Complex process dependencies
- Custom keybindings

### Example Comparison

```yaml
# mprocs.yaml
procs:
  api:
    cmd: cd packages/api && npm run dev
  web:
    cmd: cd packages/web && npm run dev
```

```bash
# muxa (no config needed)
muxa -s api dev -s web dev
```

## vs npm-run-all

[npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all) runs npm scripts in parallel or series.

### Advantages of muxa

- **Any package manager** - Not just npm
- **Mixed commands** - Not limited to npm scripts
- **Better output** - Terminal UI vs interleaved logs
- **Workspace support** - Cross-package scripts

### When to use npm-run-all

- Only running npm scripts
- Need series execution
- Pattern matching scripts
- Existing npm-run-all setup

### Example Comparison

```bash
# npm-run-all
npm-run-all --parallel lint:* test:*

# muxa (explicit but flexible)
muxa -c 'npm run lint:js' \
     -c 'npm run lint:css' \
     -c 'npm run test:unit' \
     -c 'npm run test:e2e'
```

## vs Turbo

[Turbo](https://turbo.build/) is a build system for monorepos.

### Different Use Cases

muxa and Turbo solve different problems:

- **muxa** - Process runner for development
- **Turbo** - Build system with caching

### When to use each

**Use muxa for:**

- Development servers
- Watch modes
- Mixed commands
- Simple parallel execution

**Use Turbo for:**

- Build pipelines
- Task caching
- Complex dependencies
- CI optimization

### They work together

```bash
# Use Turbo for builds
turbo build

# Use muxa for development
muxa -s web dev -s api dev
```

## vs Nx

[Nx](https://nx.dev/) is a build system and monorepo tool.

### Different Philosophy

- **muxa** - Lightweight process runner
- **Nx** - Full monorepo solution

### Complementary Tools

```bash
# Nx for builds and tests
nx build myapp
nx test myapp

# muxa for development
muxa -s myapp serve -s api serve
```

## vs PM2

[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is a production process manager.

### Different Purposes

- **muxa** - Development tool
- **PM2** - Production deployment

### Key Differences

- muxa focuses on developer experience
- PM2 handles production concerns
- muxa has interactive features
- PM2 has monitoring/clustering

## vs Docker Compose

Docker Compose orchestrates containers.

### Can Work Together

```bash
# Start services with Docker Compose
# Run apps with muxa
muxa -c 'docker-compose up' services \
     -s frontend dev \
     -s backend dev
```

### Different Scopes

- Docker Compose for containerized services
- muxa for local development processes

## Choosing the Right Tool

<Callout type="info">
  **Quick Guide**: If you need interactive features or work in a monorepo, choose muxa. For simple
  CI pipelines, concurrently might be enough. For production, consider PM2 or systemd.
</Callout>

### Decision Tree

1. **Need interactive features?** → muxa
2. **Working in a monorepo?** → muxa
3. **Just CI/CD pipelines?** → concurrently
4. **Need build caching?** → Turbo/Nx
5. **Production deployment?** → PM2/systemd
6. **Want config files?** → mprocs directly

## Summary

muxa fills a specific niche:

- Better than concurrently for development
- Simpler than mprocs to use
- Focused on running, not building
- Designed for modern monorepos

Choose muxa when you want the best developer experience for running multiple processes during development.
