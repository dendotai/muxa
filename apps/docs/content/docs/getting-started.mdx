# Getting Started

Get up and running with muxa in minutes.

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to use muxa is to run multiple commands in parallel:

```bash
muxa 'npm run dev' 'npm run test:watch'
```

This will:

1. Start both commands in separate terminal panes
2. Show live output from each command
3. Allow you to switch between panes with keyboard shortcuts
4. Automatically handle process cleanup on exit

## Understanding Modes

muxa supports two distinct modes:

### Basic Mode

Direct command arguments without flags:

```bash
muxa 'npm run dev' 'npm run test' 'npm run lint:watch'
```

### Advanced Mode

Using flags for more control:

```bash
muxa -c 'npm run dev' api -c 'npm run test' tests
```

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important**: You cannot mix these modes. Choose one style and use it consistently in a single
  command.
</Callout>

## Common Workflows

### Development Server + Tests

```bash
# Run your dev server and tests in watch mode
muxa -c 'npm run dev' server -c 'npm run test:watch' tests
```

### Multiple Services

```bash
# Start frontend, backend, and database
muxa -c 'npm run frontend:dev' web \
     -c 'npm run backend:dev' api \
     -c 'docker-compose up postgres' db
```

### Monorepo Development

If you're working in a monorepo, muxa makes it easy to run scripts from different packages:

```bash
# Run dev scripts in specific workspaces
muxa -s frontend dev -s backend dev -s shared build:watch
```

## Interactive Features

Once muxa is running, you can:

- **Switch panes**: Use arrow keys or click
- **Scroll output**: Mouse wheel or keyboard
- **Copy text**: Select with mouse
- **Exit**: Press `Ctrl+C` or `q`

All your tools' interactive features are preserved:

- Vite's dev server shortcuts work normally
- Expo QR codes display correctly
- Interactive prompts function as expected

## Tips

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Name your processes Give processes meaningful names for easier identification: ```bash muxa
    -c 'npm run dev' frontend -c 'npm run api' backend ```
  </Step>

<Step>
  ### List available workspaces In a monorepo, see all detected packages: ```bash muxa workspaces
  ```
</Step>

  <Step>
    ### Use shell features Commands with shell operators are automatically handled: ```bash muxa -c
    'npm run build && npm test' -c 'echo "Starting..." && npm run dev' ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
